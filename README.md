## ADA Assessment 2

This project my answers to my Algorithm Design & Analysis paper's first assessment.

This assessment was about creating a thread pool and providing tasks for it to complete.

I designed a server-based paint board. The server has a pool of threads with multiple tasks such as listening for the connection of a new client, the client information on the server/listening for client responses, and actions for what to do to the paint board. 

## To Run

* To run the server, open "Server.java" and run the file

* To connect to the server, make sure the server is running then open "Client.java" and run the file

* Draw on the board and the information will be shared to another connected client
